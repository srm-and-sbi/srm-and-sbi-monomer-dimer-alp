"""ReaDDy primitives for the reaction-diffusion simulation (RDS) stage.

This module wraps the ReaDDy 2 particle-based reaction-diffusion solver
(Hoffmann et al., 2019, "ReaDDy 2: Fast and flexible software framework
for interacting particle reaction dynamics", PLoS Comp Bio.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006830) for the three-species DIMER
model used by this sibling.

Three molecular species:
    A = Monomer
    B = Mobile Dimer
    C = Immobile Dimer

Two reactions:
    A + A <-> B    (dimerization / dissociation; the forward rate is
                    parameterized relative to the diffusion-limited cap)
    B    <-> C    (immobilization / mobilization)

Functions:
    build_system(theta, ...)
        Builds the ReaDDy ReactionDiffusionSystem: registers species with
        their diffusion constants and adds the four reactions. Returns the
        configured system, ready to be wrapped in a Simulation.

    build_simulation(stem, theta, ...)
        Wraps the system in a Simulation, registers observables (per-frame
        particle positions, per-step reaction counts), and places initial
        particles uniformly in the box. Returns the runnable Simulation.

    extract_trajectory_poses(tray, ...)
        Reads a saved .h5 trajectory file and produces a dense
        (frame, particle, spatial-dim, species-rank) tensor of particle
        positions, optionally accompanied by a boolean dimer mask flagging
        which particles are in the B or C states at each frame.

    Args:
        theta: Learnable-parameter values (physical units, exp-transformed from

            Initial particle placement and the imaging pipeline are unaffected.

    Returns:
        A configured `readdy.ReactionDiffusionSystem`, ready to be passed to
        `build_simulation`.

    Diffusion model:
        - The monomer diffusion `D_A` is the learnable parameter `diffusivity_alp`.
        - Dimer diffusions are specified RELATIVE to `D_A`:
              `D_B = R_B * D_A`,  `D_C = R_C * D_A`,
          where `R_B` and `R_C` are the learnable parameters
          `relative_diffusivity_bet` and `relative_diffusivity_chi`.
          The prior samples these ratios directly. Storing relative values
          guarantees `D_B` and `D_C` track the magnitude of `D_A` without
          requiring the prior to encode their joint dependence.

    Reaction model — dimerization:
        Dimerization (A + A -> B) is parameterized by `R_ON`, a dimensionless
        ratio in (0, 1] of the macroscopic rate to the diffusion-limited cap:

              kappa_ON = R_ON * kappa_ON_CAP
              kappa_ON_CAP = 4 * pi * D_R * rho_CAP      (Smoluchowski)

        with `D_R = 2 * D_A` (relative diffusion coefficient of two A particles)
        and `rho_CAP = capture_radius` (in micrometres, converted from nm).
        The microscopic ReaDDy rate is then:

              lamb_ON = kappa_ON / V_CAP
              V_CAP = (4/3) * pi * rho_CAP^3            (effective capture volume)

        Parameterizing via R_ON instead of an absolute kappa_ON guarantees
        the macroscopic rate never exceeds the physically attainable
        diffusion-limited rate, regardless of how the prior is sampled.

    Reaction model — other reactions:
        Dissociation (B -> A + A), immobilization (B -> C), and mobilization
        (C -> B) are parameterized by absolute macroscopic rates in counts
        per second. The corresponding microscopic rates are just the
        macroscopic rates with ReaDDy's per-second unit attached.

    Boundary conditions:
        [False, False, True] — the simulation box is open in xy (the
        observation plane) and periodic in z (the thin direction
        perpendicular to the membrane).
