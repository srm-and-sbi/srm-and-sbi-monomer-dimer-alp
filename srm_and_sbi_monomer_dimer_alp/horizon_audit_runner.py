"""Shared engine for the horizon audit (continuous-versus-reset window comparison).

The audit tests the reset assumption the experimental window analysis rests on: the estimator is
trained on independently initialized model-window simulations, but deployed on consecutive windows
of continuous recordings whose later windows inherit latent state. The kernel
(:mod:`horizon_audit`) holds the statistics; this runner orchestrates the phases, each an explicit
CLI subcommand so the expensive stages can be split across machines and resumed:

    prepare  -- draw the theta cohort from the training prior once, stamp it with a cohort
                digest, and persist it. Every later phase reads this one file, so parallel
                workers on different machines see the SAME cohort, and every artifact carries the
                digest so a stale file from an older cohort is refused, never silently mixed in.
    generate -- per theta: ONE continuous long simulation rendered as a video (with the per-frame
                species populations extracted from its trajectory -- the ground truth for dynamic
                state), plus R independently initialized reset simulations at the same theta.
                CPU-bound (ReaDDy + renderer); embarrassingly parallel over theta via
                --theta-start/--theta-stop, one output file per theta.
    infer    -- slice every stored video into model-length windows and run the trained estimator
                on each: posterior quantiles + raw draws per window. GPU-bound; same per-theta
                range splitting, one result file per theta.
    analyze  -- aggregate everything into the audit statistics, the report and the figures.
                CPU-only.
    selftest -- pure-python checks of the audit's decision-critical logic (truth references,
                seed uniqueness, coverage disaggregation, stale-cohort rejection, the
                absolute-versus-signed contrast, the equivalence verdict). No simulation, no GPU.

DESIGN DECISIONS.

* STATE TRUTH = THE WINDOW-START POPULATION. The estimator's count labels are the initial
  populations of its training windows, so the start state is what it was trained to report.
  The within-window mean and end populations, and the unrounded theta label, are retained as
  explicitly secondary sensitivity references -- judging against them manufactures an estimand
  mismatch that can dwarf the real error (measured on the smoke: 36 pp fake vs ~1 pp real).
* PRIMARY STATISTIC = PAIRED ABSOLUTE-ERROR CONTRAST. |continuous error| minus the same
  trajectory's mean |reset error|: a bias-only (signed) contrast can read zero while accuracy
  collapses symmetrically. Signed contrasts are reported as a secondary bias read.
* THREE-OUTCOME VERDICTS AGAINST PRESPECIFIED MARGINS. Absence of a detected difference is not
  evidence of equivalence: each primary estimand carries a prespecified equivalence margin
  (default: the estimator's own in-model error on the 10,000-video held-out recovery -- a
  degradation smaller than the instrument's own error is practically negligible), and the
  verdict is degraded / equivalent / inconclusive from the trajectory-bootstrap CI.
* PRIMARY ESTIMANDS ARE PREDECLARED: the dimer-complex fraction f_D (state, judged against the
  start truth), D_A and kappa_OFF (constants, judged against theta). Every other parameter is
  exploratory: reported, never verdicted (multiplicity).
* COVERAGE IS NEVER POOLED ACROSS ESTIMAND KINDS. Constants (R_ON excluded -- already known
  unidentified) are reported separately from the counts, whose "coverage" against the stale t=0
  truth measures state drift, not calibration; f_D coverage is computed from the within-draw
  fraction distribution against the start truth.
* SEEDS ARE SPAWNED, PERSISTED, AND NEVER SHARED. A master seed (drawn and persisted at prepare
  when not supplied) derives one placement seed and one render seed per (theta, arm, replicate)
  via ``numpy.random.SeedSequence`` -- resets are independently randomized, not copies of one
  stream. ReaDDy's internal reaction/diffusion RNG has no exposed seed and stays OS-seeded, so
  trajectories are not bit-reproducible; placements and renders are.
* The imaging vector is PINNED for every render, continuous and reset alike, to the calibrated
  ``Nuisance_DLI`` + MET SCOPE vector -- a MET-conditioned, training-supported imaging SLICE
  (training additionally varied the SCOPE camera nuisance box), resolved by the same helper the
  posterior-predictive render uses. Identical imaging on both sides makes the paired contrast
  cancel everything but the inherited state.
* Videos are stored uint8 through the same fixed-range 16-to-8-bit conversion the training zarr
  sets and the experimental recordings both pass through, and windows are stepped exactly as the
  Experiment stage steps real recordings.
* Window estimates are posterior draws (quantiles + raw cloud), not MAP points: every audit
  estimand is a posterior functional, and sampling is two orders of magnitude cheaper per window
  than seed-then-optimize MAP. The default sampler is ``unrestricted``, matching the
  experimental-baseline methodology; the outside-the-box flow-mass diagnostic REQUIRES it.
* The trajectory (one theta) is the independent statistical unit everywhere; windows within a
  trajectory are correlated and are never treated as replicates.

This analysis is post-hoc and ad-hoc: it validates a deployment practice of the canonical
pipeline and stays out of the stage dispatcher, like the other Analysis utilities.

    memory (identity churn during the render, not initial density -- denser draws completed).
    Those two are dead weight: they can never contribute a result on this hardware.

    WHY APPENDING IS SOUND. The completed draws are already a sample of the prior CONDITIONED on

    from the same prior and keeping those that complete samples that same conditional
    distribution, which is ordinary rejection sampling: it adds draws without moving the

    they stay in the cohort file as a permanent record of what could not be realized, and the
