"""Detector RDS forward model (adapted): diffusion-only three-species simulation.

Part of the Detector calibration workflow (see the implementation plan in DETECTOR_WORKFLOW.md). The
Detector infers the imaging parameters with the reaction-diffusion parameters
marginalized as a nuisance, so this module runs the reaction-diffusion simulator
in its diffusion-only mode and sources the reaction-diffusion parameters from the
Detector's RDS nuisance rather than the canonical learnable θ.

It reuses the canonical building blocks **by import** — `build_system` (with
`pure_diffusion=True`) and `build_simulation` — and adds only the parameter
sourcing: it draws the six nuisance parameters (three species counts + three
diffusion coefficients) and assembles them into the
length-`len(PARAMETERIZATION)` vector those building blocks expect, in the
canonical learnable order. The four reaction-rate slots are filled with the
canonical default `VALUE`; `build_system` reads them but never uses them when
`pure_diffusion=True` (the reaction registrations are skipped). Nothing in the
canonical modules is modified. Trajectory extraction (`extract_trajectory_poses`)
is reused directly from `simulation_rds_support` by the entry script.
