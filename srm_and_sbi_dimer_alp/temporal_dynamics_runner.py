"""Shared engine for the temporal-dynamics analysis (biology and detector workflows).

Both workflows ask the same question of a different parameter vector: the Experiment stage
estimates parameters independently in every non-overlapping window of every experimental
recording, so stacking the windows along time asks whether the inferred value holds still across
the recording. The numerics are the workflow-agnostic ``temporal_dynamics`` kernel; this runner
feeds it, draws the figures, and writes the report.

WHY BOTH WORKFLOWS MATTER HERE, AND WHY NEITHER SUFFICES ALONE. A trend in an inferred parameter
is either real dynamics or an acquisition confound, and each workflow is structurally blind to its
own confound: biology holds imaging FIXED, so it cannot see imaging drift; the detector
marginalizes the reaction-diffusion block, so it cannot see biological drift. Running the same
analysis on both, over the SAME recordings, is therefore not a symmetry exercise -- it is the only
way either result can be read. The two share the recordings exactly: the experimental path pattern
carries no workflow qualifier, so cell index ``c`` is the same acquisition in both.

WHAT IS PLOTTED, AND WHAT IS MEASURED, ARE DELIBERATELY SEPARATE. The drift statistics are fit per
cell and then aggregated, so they do not depend on the choice of central estimate; the central
estimate governs only what the figures display.

THE CENTRAL-ESTIMATE VOCABULARY. Every figure states which of four estimates it draws, and the name
says which axis was aggregated and how:

    mean-window       mean value vector, aggregated across cells for a given chunk    -> timeseries
    sgm-window        realized value vector, aggregated across cells for a given chunk -> timeseries
    mean-trajectory   mean value vector, aggregated across chunks and cells            -> one vector
    sgm-trajectory    realized value vector, aggregated across chunks and cells        -> one vector

``--central`` selects the FAMILY (``sgm`` or ``mean``) and the pairing is enforced: the timeseries
uses that family's ``*-window`` estimate and the horizontal summary line its ``*-trajectory``
counterpart, so one figure never mixes a mean with a medoid. A "mean" estimate aggregates each
parameter independently, so its coordinates need not have co-occurred in any recording; a "realized"
estimate is an actual (cell, chunk) window selected as the exact medoid, so its coordinates did.

The per-workflow differences -- parameter table and keys, prior box, alias-qualified paths, display
names, unit labels, and the external reference values -- are resolved once in
:func:`_temporal_dynamics_spec`.

    ``"log"``     bins uniform in decades, which is where a log-uniform prior is flat. Height is a
                  density PER DECADE and the prior is the horizontal line ``1 / (hi - lo)``. This
                  resolves the whole prior range evenly, so a parameter spanning 1..316 is legible
                  across its entire support.
    ``"linear"``  bins uniform in absolute units, matching the linear value axis the time-course
                  figures use. Height is a density PER UNIT. The prior is then NOT flat: pushing a
                  log-uniform density through ``x = 10**y`` gives ``p(x) = 1 / ((hi - lo) x ln 10)``,
                  a 1/x curve, and that curve is what gets drawn. A flat line here would be simply
                  wrong, and would make every parameter look as though its low end had been
                  disfavored by the data when it was only the change of variable.

    Exactly ONE vertical line per condition is drawn -- the statistic named by ``mark_name``, chosen
    with ``--pooled-mark``. Drawing several candidate summaries at once made the figure unreadable,
    and the comparison between them belongs in the report's table, where a reader can consult every
    candidate and the ratio between them without the plot paying for it.

    The default is the marginal median of the plotted mixture, because a line on a one-dimensional
    histogram is read as the center of THAT histogram, which the trajectory-level medoid does not
    claim to be: the medoid is a single jointly realized vector, so one of its coordinates can sit
    far from that coordinate's marginal center with nothing being wrong. Pass
    ``--pooled-mark trajectory`` to mark the medoid instead.
