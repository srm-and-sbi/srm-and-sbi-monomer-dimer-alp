"""Shared machinery for the Detector real-data stages (Experiment + Nuisance_DLI).

Two Detector steps read the same real recordings and run the same estimator over
them with the same overall shape:

    load the estimator  ->  discover the cells on disk  ->  read each recording and
    window it into model-length chunks  ->  run the estimator per chunk  ->  aggregate.

The Detector *Experiment* stage MAP-estimates each chunk and reports the inferred
imaging parameters per condition; the *Nuisance_DLI* analysis draws posterior samples
per chunk and pools them into the marginalized imaging distribution. Both are pooled
over whole cells, so the per-chunk work is embarrassingly parallel and the result is
order-independent.

That makes a single multi-GPU pattern serve both: launch one worker per GPU
(``torchrun``), split the flat ``(kind, cell)`` work list across workers round-robin by
rank (each worker owns whole cells), have each worker write its partial arrays as a
compressed ``_shard_*_of_*.npz`` next to the output, and then run a separate,
single-process, no-GPU ``--merge`` step that concatenates the shards into the final
product (a report for the Experiment; a cached pool + emitted spec for the Nuisance_DLI).
With one worker (``world_size == 1``) the sharding is a no-op: the single process does
all cells and produces the product directly, with no shard and no merge.

This module holds exactly the pieces both stages share -- cell discovery, per-cell
read+window, rank round-robin, the shard path, and the shard save/load/merge -- so the
two stages stay byte-for-byte identical in how they discover, window, shard, and merge.
The estimation itself (MAP vs. posterior-sample pool) stays in each stage.
