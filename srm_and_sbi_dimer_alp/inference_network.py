"""PyTorch ANN architecture for the inference stage.

This module defines the **embedding network** that maps a video tensor
`[batch, time, height, width]` to a latent embedding `[batch, embed_dim]`.
The embedding is then consumed by a downstream density estimator (a masked
autoregressive flow, MAF) that learns the posterior `p(theta | video)`.

Forward pipeline:

      v   Complex3DCNN (3D convolutional encoder)
      |   - 3D convs capture local spatio-temporal patterns (a particle's
      |     PSF + its motion across a few neighboring frames).
      |   - Spatial dims are halved at each layer via MaxPool3d.
      |   - Temporal dim T is preserved through the conv stack.

      v   Spatial averaging  ->  [B, C, T]

      |   - Captures long-range temporal dependencies that 3D convs
      |     cannot reach with small kernels.

    The CLS-token embedding IS the output, suitable as a conditioning input for
    a downstream MAF density estimator that learns the full posterior
    p(theta | video).

    Why this architecture?
        - 3D convolutions capture LOCAL spatio-temporal features (a single
          particle's appearance and its motion across a few frames).
        - The temporal transformer captures LONG-RANGE temporal dependencies
          across many frames, which small 3D conv kernels cannot reach.
        - Spatial pooling -- and, for long videos, the first conv's temporal
          stride -- reduce dimensionality before the attention stage, whose
          cost grows with the (reduced) temporal length T'.

    Args:
        n_frames: Number of temporal frames in the input video. The network
            uses a dummy forward pass at construction to infer the output
            shape after the 3D conv stack, so `n_frames` is required (cannot
            be inferred at construction without an actual input). Compute as
            `total_time_seconds / frame_time_seconds` for the configured run.
        input_channels: Channels in the input video (1 for grayscale).
        n_conv_layers: Number of 3D conv blocks in the backbone.
        n_attn_layers: Number of AttentionBlocks in the TemporalTransformer
            (only used if `use_temporal_attention=True`).
        start_channels: Output channels of the first conv block; doubles each
            block. With `start_channels=8` and `n_conv_layers=5`, the final
            channel count is 128.
        use_temporal_attention: If True, summarize the temporal sequence via
            TemporalTransformer (CLS token output). If False, average over T.
        attention_heads: Number of attention heads in each AttentionBlock.
            Must divide `start_channels * 2^(n_conv_layers-1)`.
        temporal_target_frames: Target temporal length, in FRAMES, for long
            videos. The video is reduced by an integer factor
            `s = n_frames // temporal_target_frames`, folded into the first
            conv's temporal stride (with the temporal kernel widened to
            `max(3, s)` so kernel >= stride, i.e. consecutive windows leave no
            gap -- this is pooling, never decimation), so the activations and the
            transformer sequence stay bounded regardless of duration. The
            resulting length is the standard conv output size,
            `T_out = (n_frames + 2*pad - kernel) // s + 1` with `pad = 0`
            whenever `s > 1`, so the target is a FACTOR and not an exact output
            length: 250 frames with target 100 gives `s = 2` and `T_out = 124`,
            not 100. The kernel is then widened to the smallest value congruent
            to `n_frames` modulo `s`, which makes `(n_frames - kernel) % s == 0`
            so the final window ends exactly on the last frame and EVERY input
            frame is read. This is asserted at construction and costs nothing:
            the output length is unchanged (it only drops the unusable
            remainder). Note `s` is floor division, so a video below
            `2 * target` frames is not reduced at all. Videos with `n_frames <= temporal_target_frames` are left
            unchanged (`s = 1`: the first block reduces to the original
            (3,3,3)/stride-1 conv, so short videos and the 2 s baseline are
            bit-identical to the un-reduced network). Because
            `n_frames = duration_seconds * frame_rate`, a given target maps to a
            different physical duration per frame rate (100 frames = 2 s @ 50
            FPS = 1 s @ 100 FPS = 4 s @ 25 FPS). `None` disables the reduction.
