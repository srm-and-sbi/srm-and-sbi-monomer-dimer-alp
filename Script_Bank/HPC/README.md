# HPC Operations Runbook — srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp

The single authoritative reference for running the DIMER pipeline on a Slurm
cluster. The batch scripts in this directory are generic and committed; each
machine supplies its own values through a gitignored `hpc_local.env`, so the
same scripts run unchanged on any cluster.

This runbook describes what the scripts in `Script_Bank/HPC/` actually do.
Treat the `#SBATCH` blocks and header examples inside those scripts as the
ground truth and replicate them; this document organizes and explains them.

---

## 1. Stages and partitions

The pipeline runs as a sequence of stages, each driven by one batch script
here. Each script activates the `SRM_AND_SBI_ENVY_V0` conda environment and
runs the matching entry point under `Script_Bank/Prime/`.

| Stage | Script | Compute | Production partition | Check partition |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Simulation (RDS → DLI) | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Simulation.sh` | CPU | `general1` | `test` |
| Inference (train + select) | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Inference.sh` | GPU | `gpu` | `gpu_test` |
| Evaluation (MAP recovery) | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Evaluation.sh` | GPU | `gpu` | `gpu_test` |
| Experiment (real videos) | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Experiment.sh` | GPU | `gpu` | `gpu_test` |

- **Simulation** packs many generation tasks per node (RDS reaction-diffusion
  trajectories, then DLI diffraction-limited videos) and is CPU-bound.
- **Inference** trains the posterior on the TRAIN tasks and selects on the
  TEST tasks. It adapts to the allocation: more than one **node** trains
  data-parallel *across nodes* (`srun` + `torchrun`, one process per GPU, all ranks
  bound by a c10d rendezvous); one node with more than one GPU trains data-parallel
  on that node (`torchrun --standalone`); one GPU uses the single-GPU path.
- **Evaluation** estimates the maximum-a-posteriori parameter vector on the
  held-out EVAL set and reports per-parameter recovery accuracy and posterior
  calibration. It shards EVAL across one worker per GPU on every allocated node
  (`torchrun`, or `srun` + `torchrun` across nodes), each writing its own shard,
  then merges the per-shard results into one report; one GPU uses the single-GPU path.
- **Experiment** applies the trained estimator to real microscopy `.tif`
  recordings (no ground truth) and reports the inferred-parameter distribution
  per condition. It shards its `(kind, cell)` work across one worker per GPU on
  every allocated node (`torchrun`, or `srun` + `torchrun` across nodes), then
  merges the per-shard results into one report. It is the scientific end use, not
  a correctness check.

The normal ordering is **Simulation → Inference → Evaluation**. Experiment runs
once a trained posterior exists. Generation runs on the CPU partition; training,
evaluation, and the real-data application run on the GPU partition.

**Durations are general.** The codebase is duration-parameterized: the recording
length is supplied per run via `--total-time-seconds`, and the frame count
follows as `frame_count = total_time_seconds / 0.020 s` (50 frames per second).
Specific durations below (2 s, 5 s, 1 s, 10 s) are concrete examples, not a
fixed pairing; substitute the duration the campaign calls for.

---

## 2. Submission recipe

Slurm spools a copy of each batch script into `/var/spool` before running it, so
the script's own path is unreliable for a directly-submitted job. Every script
resolves the repository root with a `_find_repo` helper that tries, in order:

1. an explicit `REPO` (e.g. `--export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,...`),
2. `SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` (and its grandparent),
3. the script's own location (for a non-Slurm `bash <script>` invocation),

and accepts the first candidate that actually contains `pyproject.toml` and the
`srm_and_sbi_dimer_alp/` package. If none match, the script **fails loud** with
guidance rather than crashing on a `/var/spool` path.

**The rule:** submit from the repository root, or pass `REPO` explicitly via
`--export`. Either makes `REPO` resolvable.

```bash
cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp        # so SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR resolves the repo
# or, from anywhere, add REPO=$PWD (run from the root) to --export
```

The same resolved `REPO` is used to source the per-machine `hpc_local.env` (see
§5), so it is found even under spooling.

### Dry-run first: the submit helper

Always preview a submission before it reaches the queue. The unified
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Submit.sh` builds the exact `sbatch` command for any
stage — the resolved `REPO`, the data-pattern `--job-name` (with the rendered
`timing_label`), and a comma-split-safe `--export` — and **prints it without
submitting** unless you set `DRYRUN=0`. Because the recipe, the naming, and the
config are built by the tool, they cannot be mistyped at submit time.

```bash
# Dry run (the default): print the exact sbatch line, submit nothing
bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Submit.sh inference TOTAL_TIME=5.0 TRAIN_TASKS=400 TEST_TASKS=100 EPOCHS=25
# Submit it (only after the printed command checks out)
DRYRUN=0 GPU_PART=gpu bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Submit.sh inference TOTAL_TIME=5.0 TRAIN_TASKS=400 TEST_TASKS=100 EPOCHS=25
```

`<stage>` is `simulation | inference | evaluation | experiment`; the `KEY=VALUE`
pairs are that stage's `--export` knobs (anything omitted falls back to the
stage script's own default). sbatch-level overrides go in the environment:
`PART` (CPU partition — required for a live `simulation`, whose baked
`--partition` is a placeholder), `GPU_PART`, `ACCT`, `TIME`,
`ARRAY`/`NTPN`/`CPT` (simulation only), `GRES`, `NODES` (GPU stages — multi-node,
`--gres` is per node so `NODES=2 GRES=gpu:4` → `world_size` 8), `MON_OUT`. A multi-value `KINDS`
(e.g. `KINDS=ALP,BET`) is carried safely through the exported environment via
`ALL` rather than the comma-split `--export`. The helper is to a single job what
the generation controller (§5) is to the full generation campaign — both default
to dry-run, and you opt in to submitting with `DRYRUN=0`.

For a **local** run — or as a final configuration check before any submission —
pass `--dry-run` to the Prime entry point itself: it resolves the machine
profile and the input paths, prints what it would read and write (flagging
anything MISSING), and exits before any compute (no GPU, no data load).

```bash
MACHINE_PROFILE=<profile> python Script_Bank/Prime/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_Inference.py \
    --total-time-seconds 2.0 --tasks 8 --test-tasks 2 --epochs 50 --dry-run
```

The raw `sbatch` invocations below are the ground truth the helper generates;
use them directly when you want full manual control.

### Runnable examples (one per stage)

Submit from the repository root. Set `--partition` to the partition for the run
(production vs check, per §1); the baked `#SBATCH --partition` is a placeholder
on the Simulation script and `gpu` on the GPU scripts.

```bash
# Simulation — TRAIN split, one node, 8 packed tasks (always submit with --array)
cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp
sbatch --job-name=SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Simulation_TRAIN \
       --partition=general1 --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=8 \
       --output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A_Node_%a.out" \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=train,TASK_OFFSET=0,TASK_COUNT=8,TASK_SIMS=1000,TOTAL_TIME=2.0 \
       Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Simulation.sh
```

```bash
# Inference — train on 8 TRAIN tasks, select on 2 TEST tasks, 50 epochs
cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp
sbatch --job-name=SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Inference \
       --partition=gpu \
       --output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A.out" \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,TRAIN_TASKS=8,TEST_TASKS=2,EPOCHS=50,TOTAL_TIME=2.0 \
       Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Inference.sh
# Continue a wall-stopped run from its checkpoint: add RESURRECT=1 to the --export
# (or pass RESURRECT=1 to the Submit.sh helper). The first job runs fresh.
```

```bash
# Evaluation — MAP recovery on the held-out EVAL set
cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp
sbatch --job-name=SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Evaluation \
       --partition=gpu \
       --output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A.out" \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,EVAL_TASKS=1,SUMMARY=both,POOL_MODE=bounded,TOTAL_TIME=2.0 \
       Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Evaluation.sh
```

```bash
# Experiment — apply the trained posterior to real videos.
# KINDS defaults to ALP,BET (baked in the script). Do NOT place a multi-value
# KINDS inside --export: Slurm splits --export on commas, so KINDS=ALP,BET would
# parse as KINDS=ALP plus a stray, value-less BET. To override KINDS with multiple
# values, pre-export it in the submitting shell and let --export=ALL carry it
# (export KINDS=ALP,BET) — or just use the Submit.sh helper, which does this for you.
cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp
sbatch --job-name=SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Experiment \
       --partition=gpu \
       --output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A.out" \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SUMMARY=both,TOTAL_TIME=2.0 \
       Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Experiment.sh
```

`MON_OUT` is your monitoring/batch-log directory and **must already exist**
(see §5).

---

## 3. Job and log naming

Job names mirror the theta/video data files so a batch log and the artifacts it
produces share one provenance string. The data files are named, for example,
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Video_Set_TASK_0_TRAIN.zarr` and
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Theta_Set_TASK_0_TRAIN.zarr`: the pattern is
`{project_alias}_{timing_label}_<descriptor>`.

- **`project_alias`** = `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP`
- **`timing_label`** = `<duration>S_<FPS>FPS`, placed **immediately after the
  alias** (e.g. `1S_50FPS`, `2S_50FPS`, `5S_50FPS`). No `HPC` token.

Job names follow the same shape:

```
SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_<Stage>[_<SPLIT>]
```

| Stage | Job name |
|-------|----------|
| Simulation | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_Simulation_<SPLIT>` (SPLIT = `TRAIN`/`TEST`/`EVAL`) |
| Inference | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_Inference` |
| Evaluation | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_Evaluation` |
| Experiment | `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_Experiment` |

Examples: `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_5S_50FPS_Inference`,
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_1S_50FPS_Simulation_TRAIN`.

Set the job name with `--job-name` and direct the batch log into the monitoring
directory:

- Simulation (an array, one element per node): `--output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A_Node_%a.out"`
- All other stages: `--output="$MON_OUT/%x_%A.out"`

`%x` is the job name, `%A` the array job id, `%a` the array element (the node
number). The Simulation array element is always a clean node number because the
job is always submitted with `--array` (`--array=0-0` for a single node);
without `--array`, Slurm sets `%a` to its not-an-array sentinel.

Inside the Simulation node, each packed task additionally writes its own per-task
log: `${MON}/${job_name}_${job_tag}_Node_${array_id}_Task_${tid}.out`.

---

## 4. Hardware configurations to replicate

Use the layouts encoded in the scripts' `#SBATCH` blocks and header examples.
Do not recompute node geometry — replicate these.

### Simulation (CPU)

The baked layout packs tasks per node and pins the core geometry:

- `--nodes=1`, `--ntasks-per-node=8`, `--cpus-per-task=5`, `--mem-per-cpu=4400`
- `--extra-node-info=2:20:1` (40-core nodes: 2 sockets × 20 cores × 1 thread)
- `--time=08:00:00`

Always submit with `--array` (one element per node; `--array=0-0` for a single
node). Multi-node scaling is an `--array` of single-node jobs; `TASK_OFFSET`
shifts the global task index so a later submission appends tasks rather than
regenerating existing ones. The per-task global index is
`tid = TASK_OFFSET + SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID * ntasks_per_node + k`.

**Production (`general1`), 1000 sims/task, one node per split:**

```bash
# TRAIN 8 / TEST 2 / EVAL 1 tasks (per CORE=100), submit from the repo root:
sbatch --partition=general1 --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=8 --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=train,TASK_OFFSET=0,TASK_COUNT=8 ...Simulation.sh
sbatch --partition=general1 --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=2 --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=test,TASK_OFFSET=0,TASK_COUNT=2  ...Simulation.sh
sbatch --partition=general1 --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=1 --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=eval,TASK_OFFSET=0,TASK_COUNT=1  ...Simulation.sh
```

Larger campaigns pack 10 tasks/node with `--cpus-per-task=4` (10 × 4 = 40 cores,
matching `--extra-node-info=2:20:1`) and fan out over `--array`; the generation
controller (§5) drives this.

**Check (`test`), 1 s smoke — TRAIN 16 / TEST 4 / EVAL 2 tasks, 10 sims/task:**

```bash
sbatch --partition=test --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=16 --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=train,TASK_COUNT=16,TASK_SIMS=10,TOTAL_TIME=1.0 ...Simulation.sh
sbatch --partition=test --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=4  --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=test,TASK_COUNT=4,TASK_SIMS=10,TOTAL_TIME=1.0  ...Simulation.sh
sbatch --partition=test --array=0-0 --ntasks-per-node=2  --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,SPLIT=eval,TASK_COUNT=2,TASK_SIMS=10,TOTAL_TIME=1.0  ...Simulation.sh
```

### Inference / Evaluation / Experiment (GPU)

The GPU scripts bake a single-node default that scales out with `NODES`:

- `--nodes=1` (default; override with `NODES=N` via `Submit.sh`, or `--nodes=N` on
  a raw `sbatch`), `--gres=gpu:8` (per node), `--cpus-per-task=64`, `--mem=480G`
- `--time=1-00:00:00` (Inference, Experiment); `--time=12:00:00` (Evaluation)

Inference, Evaluation, and Experiment adapt to the allocation. `--gres` is per
node, so `--nodes=N --gres=gpu:G` gives `world_size = N*G` ranks:

- **More than one node** runs the multi-node path (`srun` places one `torchrun`
  launcher per node, all ranks bound by a c10d rendezvous). Inference trains
  data-parallel across every rank on every node (SyncBatchNorm + the loss
  all-reduced across all ranks, so `--batch-size` stays per-rank and the effective
  batch is `batch*world_size`); Evaluation and Experiment shard their work across
  every rank (each writes its own shard to the shared filesystem — the rendezvous
  is unused there, kept only for one uniform GPU-binding path), then a single
  `--merge` pass combines the shards.
- **One node, more than one GPU** runs the single-node path (`torchrun
  --standalone`) — data-parallel training (Inference) or work-sharded estimation
  (Evaluation shards its EVAL videos; Experiment shards its `(kind, cell)` work),
  each followed by the merge.
- **One GPU** runs the original single-GPU path.

The GPU count per node is `SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE`, capped by the optional
`SRM_AND_SBI_GPUS`; the node count is `SLURM_NNODES` (from `--nodes`). Use the full
`gpu` partition (whole node, `gpu:8`) for validation unless a run is a genuinely
tiny throwaway. Multi-node Evaluation/Experiment need the output directory on a
shared filesystem so the merge sees every node's shards (the case on the HPC data
banks).

**Wall-limited training continues with `RESURRECT`.** Training checkpoints its
optimum each epoch. A run that will not reach its target epochs within the
partition wall is continued by relaunching the same submission with `RESURRECT=1`
(a `Submit.sh` knob, or `RESURRECT=1` in the raw `--export`): it loads that
checkpoint and resumes. The first job runs fresh; every continuation passes
`RESURRECT=1`. Repeat until the target epochs are reached. This works on the
single-GPU, single-node data-parallel, and multi-node paths alike.

To pre-submit the whole chain so each link starts **even if the previous job hit
the wall** (a timeout is recorded as a failure), gate each continuation on the
previous job id with `DEP=afterany:<jobid>` — `afterany`, not `afterok`, because an
`afterok` successor would never start after a wall-stopped predecessor:

```bash
id=$(DRYRUN=0 GPU_PART=gpu_test GRES=gpu:4 bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Submit.sh \
       inference TOTAL_TIME=5.0 TRAIN_TASKS=100 EPOCHS=10 HEARTBEAT=20 | grep -oP 'Submitted batch job \K\d+')
for _ in 1 2; do   # two continuations
  id=$(DRYRUN=0 GPU_PART=gpu_test GRES=gpu:4 DEP="afterany:$id" bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Submit.sh \
         inference TOTAL_TIME=5.0 TRAIN_TASKS=100 EPOCHS=10 HEARTBEAT=20 RESURRECT=1 | grep -oP 'Submitted batch job \K\d+')
done
```

**Check (`gpu_test`), single-GPU smoke — Inference:**

```bash
sbatch --partition=gpu_test --gres=gpu:1 --time=01:00:00 \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,TRAIN_TASKS=8,TEST_TASKS=2,EPOCHS=1 ...Inference.sh
```

**Long durations need a smaller batch.** Leaving `BATCH` unset uses the script
default (`PARAMETERS` batch size, 32). One early conv3d activation is
batch × ~1 GiB at 500 frames, so batch 32 OOMs a GPU with ~64 GB of VRAM at long durations
(e.g. a 10 s, 500-frame run); reduce `BATCH` accordingly.

**Starting learning rate: `LR`.** Both Inference wrappers (biology and detector)
forward a non-empty `LR` to the entry point as `--learning-rate`, the run's
starting (peak) learning rate; left unset, the entry point's default peak applies
(`learning_rate_minimum × max_factor` = 1.28e-03). Useful when continuing a
wall-stopped run (`RESURRECT=1`) at a chosen rate.

**Straggler protection: `EXIT_BARRIER`.** Every GPU wrapper that launches through
`torchrun` — Inference, Evaluation, and Experiment in both workflows, plus the
standalone `Posterior_Calibration` and DETECTOR `Nuisance_DLI` wrappers (§6) —
exports `TORCHELASTIC_EXIT_BARRIER_TIMEOUT="${EXIT_BARRIER:-3600}"`. torch-elastic's
own default is 300 s: the ranks that finish first wait only five minutes for the
rest and then tear down the rendezvous, which kills any rank still working and
discards its results. The sharded stages are embarrassingly parallel and routinely
skewed (a rank drawing two tasks takes twice as long as one drawing a single task),
so the wrappers raise the barrier to 3600 s by default; set `EXIT_BARRIER` higher
if a run's skew demands it — the job wall time is the real bound.

**Smoke / check evaluation uses `--pool-mode unrestricted`.** An undertrained
posterior's probability mass can fall outside the prior box, and the default
`bounded` rejection sampling stalls on it. Pass `POOL_MODE=unrestricted` for any
smoke or undertrained-posterior evaluation; `bounded` is only for a fully
trained posterior. (See the MAP-recovery validation in `VALIDATION.md`.)

```bash
sbatch --partition=gpu_test --gres=gpu:1 --time=01:00:00 \
       --export=ALL,REPO=$PWD,EVAL_TASKS=1,SUMMARY=both,POOL_MODE=unrestricted,TOTAL_TIME=1.0 ...Evaluation.sh
```

## 5. Generation controller and per-machine config

### Generation controller

`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Generate_Controller.sh` is a rolling submit-and-gate
controller for a full generation campaign. It submits the per-split generation
arrays (train first), keeps within the QOS caps (≤40 running, ≤50 in-system),
then **hard-gates** the EVAL splits until every TRAIN + TEST job has reached
`COMPLETED`. If any train/test job ends in a non-`COMPLETED` state it stops
before submitting EVAL, so EVAL is never generated against broken data.

- **Dry run is the default.** With no override it prints the exact `sbatch`
  lines and submits nothing:

  ```bash
  bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Generate_Controller.sh
  ```

- **Live submission** requires `DRYRUN=0`. It polls for hours to days, so run it
  on the login node inside `tmux`/`screen`:

  ```bash
  DRYRUN=0 bash Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Generate_Controller.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/dimer_gen_controller.log
  ```

- `CASES` selects which dataset(s) to drive (`5s` | `2s` | `both`, default
  `both`), so one controller can run separate campaigns on separate clusters.
- Re-run a failed node/task under its **original global label** (same `SPLIT` /
  `TASK_SIMS` / `TOTAL_TIME`, with `TASK_OFFSET`/`TASK_COUNT` set to the gap):
  this fills the gap via the incremental-append mechanism and regenerates
  nothing good. Confirm label completeness before training.

### Per-machine config: `hpc_local.env`

Every script in this directory sources `Script_Bank/HPC/hpc_local.env` at
startup (via the resolved `REPO`, so it is found even under spooling). The file
is **gitignored** and never committed; each machine supplies its own values,
which keeps the committed scripts generic. Create it from the template:

```bash
cp Script_Bank/HPC/hpc_local.env.example Script_Bank/HPC/hpc_local.env
# then edit for this machine
```

Settings it provides:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `MACHINE_PROFILE` | profile in `machine_profiles.toml` (selects this machine's data/compute paths) — **required**; the scripts fail loud if unset |
| `CONDA_SETUP` | path to the conda `profile.d/conda.sh` that defines `conda` in a non-interactive shell |
| `MON` / `MON_OUT` | monitoring / batch-log output directory (**must already exist**) |
| `PART` | CPU partition for Simulation submissions — consumed by the `Submit.sh` dispatchers and the generation controllers alike (passed only when set) |
| `ACCT` | Slurm account, if the cluster requires one — likewise consumed by the dispatchers and the controllers (passed only when set) |
| `USER_ME` | queue-owner username for the controller's polling (defaults to `$USER`) |
| `REPO` | auto-derived from the script location; override only if the repo is reached by a different path |

Anything left unset falls back to the script defaults (e.g.
`MON` → `$HOME/process_monitoring`), and an unset `PART`/`ACCT` leaves the
submit line at the script's baked defaults.

### Fleet sync: propagating the repo

`Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_Fleet_Sync.sh` is the **single supported
way to propagate this repository** to the other machines; hand-rolled `rsync`
invocations have failed in the documented ways its header records, so do not
improvise one. It reconciles every remote's repo to the reference machine exactly:
the file list is always relative to the repo root (nothing flattens into the wrong
directory), deletions on the reference propagate (per-directory recursion with
`--delete`), the secrets file never leaves the reference machine, and each
remote's own machine-local files (`machine_profiles.toml`,
`Script_Bank/HPC/hpc_local.env`) are never touched. Dry run is the default
(`DRYRUN=1` prints what would change and transfers nothing; set `DRYRUN=0` only
after reading the printed plan), and an optional machine argument restricts the
sync to one remote.

---

## 6. Special-situation entry points (run ad hoc)

The four stages in §1 form the standard, dispatcher-driven pipeline. A handful of
ad-hoc utilities sit outside it — the post-hoc analyses and calibration builders in
`Script_Bank/Analysis/` (for example the pooled `Nuisance_DLI` construction, the
embedding-space distance, and the flicker-rate derivation). They stay out of the
`Submit.sh` dispatchers by design, so the standard dispatcher surface stays exactly
the four stages — but three of them have dedicated standalone wrappers in this
directory, submitted directly with `sbatch`:

- `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Posterior_Calibration.sh` — the posterior-calibration
  diagnostic (SBC / coverage / TARP / L-C2ST) for either workflow
  (`WORKFLOW=biology|detector`). It shares the Evaluation stage's shard-then-merge
  execution: one worker per GPU on every allocated node writes its own shard, then
  a single `--merge` pass concatenates them and runs the global statistics.
- `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_HPC_Nuisance_DLI.sh` — the pooled `Nuisance_DLI`
  spec-template build (`--emit-template`): shards the `(kind, cell)` pool build
  across one worker per GPU on every allocated node, then a single-process, no-GPU
  `--merge` step assembles the cached pool and the spec.
- `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Embedding_Space_Distance.sh` — the
  experimental-versus-synthetic embedding-space distance for either workflow
  (`WORKFLOW=biology|detector`). Its engine is single-GPU by design (no sharding,
  no merge) on a whole-node allocation; do not read the allocated GPUs as data
  parallelism.

The rest are run by hand — single-process with plain `python`, not `torchrun` —
and each is documented in its own companion `.md`. When one of those needs a GPU,
launch it with a one-off `sbatch --wrap` on the check partition that sources
`hpc_local.env` (§5) and activates `SRM_AND_SBI_ENVY_V0`, following the §3
job-name pattern with the utility's own descriptor. The DETECTOR calibration
workflow has its own submission machinery (§8).

---

## 7. Artifact backups

The trained artifacts — an estimator (`Posit/…_Estimator.npz`) and its checkpoint
(`Labor/…_Optimum_ANN.pth`) — are overwritten in place whenever the stage that
produces them re-runs (a fresh Inference run). The canonical names never change:
they are the live objects every downstream stage (Evaluation, Experiment) loads.
To keep a superseded model
identifiable and recoverable after it is overwritten, a copy is set aside under a
distinct name — automatically by a finished run, or by hand for an ad-hoc keep.

### Automatic provenance backup

A finished Inference run that loaded a TEST set (`--test-tasks > 0`, so a
model-selection loss exists) writes, alongside the canonical checkpoint and
estimator, a provenance-named copy of each. The suffix records the run's training
scale and result in the filename itself — legible at a glance, without opening the
artifact — inserted before the extension:

    <original-stem>_TRAIN+TEST_<train>+<test>_Epoch_<n>_TEST_LOSS_<loss>.<ext>

- **`<train>` / `<test>`** — the number of TRAIN and TEST videos the run used, as
  thousands-tokens (`50000` → `50K`, `47500` → `47.5K`). Sizes are in the name
  because a test loss is only comparable at equal test-set size: a −17.00 measured
  on 50K selection videos is not the same result as −17.00 on 10K.
- **`Epoch_<n>`** — the number of epochs this job ran (`--epochs`), counted for the
  current job (a warm-started `--resurrect` run counts its own epochs, not the
  history of the weights it loaded).
- **`TEST_LOSS_<loss>`** — the checkpoint's best TEST loss, always exactly two
  decimals. A negative loss keeps its native `-`; a positive loss gets an explicit
  `+`; a value that rounds to zero is written `0.00`, with no sign.

For a 200K-train / 50K-test run over 25 epochs that reached a best test loss of
−17.05, the pair is:

    Labor/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Optimum_ANN_TRAIN+TEST_200K+50K_Epoch_25_TEST_LOSS_-17.05.pth
    Posit/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Estimator_TRAIN+TEST_200K+50K_Epoch_25_TEST_LOSS_-17.05.npz

The backup is a copy, so the canonical `…_Optimum_ANN.pth` / `…_Estimator.npz`
stay the active artifacts and a backup is never picked up as the live model. Across
warm-started runs the canonical checkpoint is additionally protected by
save-on-improvement — it is overwritten only when the current run beats the loaded
best on the TEST set — so each accepted optimum is preserved under its own backup
name. To make a backup the active model again, copy it onto the canonical name.

A run with no TEST set (`--test-tasks 0`, which trains on all of TRAIN and keeps
the last-epoch checkpoint) has no selection loss to name a backup by, so it writes
the canonical pair only.

### Manual ad-hoc keep

The automatic backup covers finished training runs. To preserve an artifact the
automatic scheme does not — for instance the current canonical *before* you
deliberately launch a run that will overwrite it, or a milestone worth tagging —
copy it aside by hand under a tag plus a day-month-year date, inserted before the
extension:

    <original-stem>_<TAG>_<DD.MM.YYYY>.<ext>

```bash
# preserve the current best 2S estimator + its checkpoint before an overwriting run
cp Posit/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Estimator.npz \
   Posit/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Estimator_PREPROD_01.07.2026.npz
cp Labor/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Optimum_ANN.pth \
   Labor/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_2S_50FPS_Optimum_ANN_PREPROD_01.07.2026.pth
```

`<TAG>` is a short label for why the copy was kept (e.g. `PREPROD` before a
production run); `<DD.MM.YYYY>` is the date (e.g. `01.07.2026`).

### Both kinds land beside the original

Whether automatic or manual, the suffix sits before the extension, so a backup
never matches the `…_Estimator.npz` / `…_Optimum_ANN.pth` names the pipeline loads —
it is kept, but never picked up as the active artifact. Keep each backup in the
same `Posit/` or `Labor/` directory as its original; if that storage tier is not
itself backed up (for example a scratch `data_bank_root`), also copy the backup to
a backed-up location.

## 8. Detector calibration workflow (own submission machinery)

The **Detector calibration workflow** is a complete workflow parallel to the
biology pipeline: it runs the same four-step process (simulate → infer →
evaluate → experiment) but infers the imaging (diffraction-limited-imaging)
parameters with the physics frozen to pure diffusion, so those parameters are
calibrated for production rather than hand-tuned. It has its **own committed
submission machinery**, filename-namespaced (`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_HPC_*`)
and coexisting with the biology wrappers in this directory — the same
filename-alias scheme as the `_DETECTOR` data and entry scripts. It is a separate,
parallel workflow: it is **never wired into the biology `Submit.sh` dispatcher
or the four biology stage wrappers**, and they are never wired into it.

| Detector script | Role | Compute |
|---|---|---|
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Simulation.sh` | generation: diffusion-only RDS (B1) → imaging-from-theta DLI (B2), packed per node, `--array` fan-out, seedless | CPU |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Inference.sh` | train the imaging posterior (B3); >1 GPU → DDP via `torchrun`, >1 node → DDP across nodes (`srun`+torchrun, c10d); saves the version-portable A5 estimator | GPU |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Evaluation.sh` | imaging MAP recovery on the held-out EVAL set (B5); shards across all ranks (>1 GPU/node) + a separate `--merge` step | GPU |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Experiment.sh` | imaging MAP estimation on real microscopy videos (B4); shards across all ranks (>1 GPU/node) + a separate `--merge` step | GPU |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Submit.sh` | the Detector dispatcher — dry-run-first single-job submit builder | — |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Nuisance_DLI.sh` | pooled `Nuisance_DLI` spec-template build (`--emit-template`): posterior-sample pool over the real recordings, sharded across all ranks (>1 GPU/node) + a separate no-GPU `--merge` step; submitted directly with `sbatch`, not via `Submit.sh` | GPU |
| `..._DETECTOR_HPC_Generate_Controller.sh` | rolling submit-and-gate controller for a full Detector generation campaign — QOS caps, EVAL hard-gated on TRAIN+TEST completion; dry-run by default | — |

(Posterior calibration and the embedding-space distance are covered for the
Detector by the standalone analysis wrappers in §6 —
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Posterior_Calibration.sh` and
`SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_HPC_Embedding_Space_Distance.sh`, each with
`WORKFLOW=detector`.)

**Dispatcher.** `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_HPC_Submit.sh` mirrors the
biology `Submit.sh` — dry-run first (`DRYRUN=1` prints the exact `sbatch` line;
`DRYRUN=0` submits) — for the Detector stages, and renders the `_DETECTOR`
job-name `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_<timing_label>_<Stage>[_<SPLIT>]`.

**Two GPU modes (Goethe), set explicitly at submit time.** Neither dispatcher pins
a GPU mode: both `Submit.sh` scripts only forward what the submitter sets
(a non-empty `GPU_PART`/`GRES`/`NODES` becomes `--partition`/`--gres`/`--nodes`;
anything unset leaves the stage script's baked `#SBATCH` defaults, `gpu` +
`gpu:8`). The two modes in use are therefore a manual recipe: checks set
`GPU_PART=gpu_test GRES=gpu:4 TIME=08:00:00` explicitly (the `gpu_test` nodes
carry 4 GPUs); production uses the real `gpu` partition — a whole node, `gpu:8` —
which is the baked default, so `GPU_PART=gpu` alone suffices.

**Seedless generation.** Detector generation passes no seed by design: each task
draws fresh entropy, and provenance is carried by the global task index in the
file names. `SEED` is an off-by-default reproducibility-debug knob only, and it
must be left unset for the smoke and for normal campaigns.

**8-bit video.** The DLI step of the generation stage renders 8-bit video via
the `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_HPC_Simulation.sh` `VIDEO_DTYPE_BITS` knob
(default 8), matching `VALIDATION.md` section 2.5.

**Chaining** (with `DEP=afterok:<jobid>[:...]`) — the check-run sequence
(2 s, 16/4/2 tasks × 10 sims, 5 epochs), run seedless, all DRY-RUN by default;
capture each printed job id and feed it to the next `DEP`. The authoritative
recipe is `VALIDATION.md` section 2.5 ("Detector calibration smoke test"):

    cd /path/to/srm-and-sbi-dimer-alp
    S=Script_Bank/HPC/SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_DETECTOR_HPC_Submit.sh
    # generation (CPU test partition), one job per split:
    PART=test NTPN=16 bash $S simulation SPLIT=train TASK_COUNT=16 TASK_SIMS=10 TOTAL_TIME=2.0
    PART=test NTPN=4  bash $S simulation SPLIT=test  TASK_COUNT=4  TASK_SIMS=10 TOTAL_TIME=2.0
    PART=test NTPN=2  bash $S simulation SPLIT=eval  TASK_COUNT=2  TASK_SIMS=10 TOTAL_TIME=2.0
    # train (afterok gen train+test), then evaluate (afterok train + gen eval):
    GPU_PART=gpu_test DEP=afterok:<gen-train>:<gen-test> bash $S inference  TRAIN_TASKS=16 TEST_TASKS=4 EPOCHS=5 BATCH=8 TOTAL_TIME=2.0
    GPU_PART=gpu_test DEP=afterok:<inference>:<gen-eval> bash $S evaluation EVAL_TASKS=2 POOL_MODE=unrestricted TOTAL_TIME=2.0
    # experiment (afterok inference): apply the undertrained posterior to real videos.
    # KINDS defaults to ALP,BET; because Slurm --export splits on commas, leave KINDS
    # at its default or pre-export it. POOL_MODE=unrestricted is required for the
    # undertrained smoke posterior.
    GPU_PART=gpu_test DEP=afterok:<inference> bash $S experiment MAX_CELLS=2 POOL_MODE=unrestricted TOTAL_TIME=2.0

Respect the check-partition QOS (e.g. Goethe `test`: at most 3 submitted / 2
running / 2 nodes per user) — consolidate generation accordingly.

## 9. Do not

- **Do not invent job or log names.** Use exactly
  `SRM_AND_SBI_DIMER_ALP_<timing_label>_<Stage>[_<SPLIT>]` (§3). No invented
  tokens such as `5S_PROD`, `smoke`, `mgpuval`, or an `HPC` segment.
- **Do not recompute node geometry.** Replicate the `#SBATCH` layouts and header
  examples in the scripts (§4) — the core counts, `--extra-node-info`, GPU
  count, and memory are deliberate.
- **Do not cancel and resubmit a correctly-running job for cosmetics.** A job
  whose name or log path is merely not your preference is still producing valid
  output; leave it running.
- **Do not edit the committed scripts for per-machine values.** Put machine
  differences in `hpc_local.env` (§5), not in the scripts.
- **Do not submit Simulation without `--array`.** Always pass `--array`
  (`--array=0-0` for a single node) so the log's `%a` is a clean node number.
- **Do not submit without a dry-run.** Preview every submission first — the
  `Submit.sh` helper or the generation controller with their default `DRYRUN=1`,
  or the entry point's own `--dry-run` — and submit only once the printed command
  and the resolved inputs check out (§2).
