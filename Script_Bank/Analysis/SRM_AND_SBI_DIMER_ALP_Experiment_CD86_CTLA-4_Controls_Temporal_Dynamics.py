"""Analysis entry point: temporal dynamics of the inferred parameters on the CD86 /
CTLA-4 control-receptor recordings, with a mobile-diffusion headline readout.

Special-scope analysis (ad-hoc reuse). Applies the DIMER-ALP posterior -- trained on
the MET single-particle-tracking regime -- to two control receptors from a different
study, to test whether the transferable observable (the diffusion coefficient) lands
on the independently measured values. CD86 is a constitutive monomer and CTLA-4 a
constitutive dimer; the two bracket the mobile-diffusion scale (monomer faster, dimer
slower). This entry point is not one of the canonical pipeline stages: it is a
documented reuse of a completed control Experiment run, and stays out of the stage
dispatcher.

Regenerates, from that completed control Experiment run, the per-parameter *temporal*
view of the MAP estimates. For each learnable parameter it collects the MAP estimate
from every non-overlapping video chunk, groups by time point (the chunk's position
within the recording), averages across cells, and plots the trajectory per condition
(CD86 [Monomer] and CTLA-4 [Dimer]) in absolute (physical) units.

=============================================================================
HEADLINE READOUT -- mobile mixture diffusivity  (read this first)
=============================================================================
The transferable quantity across the label / model mismatch (below) is the diffusion
coefficient. The posterior cannot reliably separate monomer from dimer for these
controls, so the headline is the count-weighted mean diffusivity of the MOBILE
populations (monomer A + mobile dimer B), excluding the immobile class C:

    D_mix_mobile = (C_A * D_A + C_B * D_B) / (C_A + C_B)   [um^2/s]

with D_A the monomer diffusivity, D_B = R_B * D_A the mobile-dimer diffusivity, and
C_A, C_B the mobile counts. D_mix lies between D_A and D_B (in either order); the
headline figure compares, per receptor, the inferred D_mix (solid, condition color)
against the experimental D_mobile (solid, a separate per-condition color, so experiment
and inference never share a color); D_A, D_B and the mobile split f_B = C_B / (C_A + C_B)
are reported in the run's report table, not drawn on the figure. On these
out-of-distribution controls the model's A / B
assignment is not physically ordered -- the relative dimer diffusivity R_B can exceed 1
(mobile dimer "faster" than monomer), and under unrestricted pooling D_A / R_B can even
leave their training priors -- which is exactly why the count-weighted D_mix, robust to
the A / B mis-assignment, is the readout rather than D_A or D_B alone. D_mix is read as a
point between D_A and D_B, not as a resolved mixture unless f_B is informative.

D_A is stored in um^2/s directly (10**theta), so D_mix_mobile is directly comparable
to an experimental mobile-fraction diffusion coefficient D_mobile with no unit
conversion. The comparison is quantitatively valid because the acquisition geometry
matches: 50 FPS, 256^2 pixels, ~157 nm/px.

Experimental reference (per condition; drawn as a colored band value +/- SD + a line):
    CD86 [Monomer]  : D_mobile = 0.319 +/- 0.010 um^2/s
    CTLA-4 [Dimer]  : D_mobile = 0.279 +/- 0.005 um^2/s
  Catapano et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, 64, e202413117 (BioImage Archive
  S-BIAD1369; SiR-S5 / HaloTag single-color tracking). The two values bracket the
  mobile-diffusion scale.

=============================================================================
LABEL / MODEL MISMATCH  (why D, and only D, transfers)
=============================================================================
The posterior was trained on always-visible permanent-label emitters; the control
recordings use an exchangeable, blinking SiR-S5 HaloTag probe. The diffusion
coefficient is a per-track property read from the displacement statistics of a
molecule while it is visible, so it is robust to how many molecules are lit at once
and survives the mismatch. Counts and rates (C_*, kappa_*, R_ON) instead depend on
the number of co-visible emitters and on track continuity, both corrupted by
blinking, so they are NOT read quantitatively here. The controls are also constitutive
monomer / dimer references, not the dynamic A + A <=> B <=> C dimerization mechanism
the posterior encodes: they bracket the diffusion scale and stress-test
transferability, they do not exercise the kinetic model.

The per-parameter temporal figures (counts, rates, ratios) are still produced -- their
downward count drift makes the blinking / bleaching confound visible -- but only the
mobile-diffusion headline carries an experimental comparison.

=============================================================================
NOT IMPLEMENTED YET -- aggregated posterior distributions  (documented on purpose)
=============================================================================
The historical figures also included, per parameter, a POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION
panel: a single histogram (per condition) of the full posterior sample cloud
pooled across every cell and every chunk of the experiment. Reproducing that
faithfully needs the per-window posterior SAMPLES, aggregated across all chunks
into one distribution per (condition, parameter). The current Experiment stage
persists only five quantiles per window (Q05/Q25/Q50/Q75/Q95), NOT the sample
pool, so the quantiles alone are insufficient (a five-number summary per window
cannot be re-pooled into the experiment-wide sample distribution the original
histogrammed). To add these panels later: draw posterior samples per (cell, chunk)
window from the trained posterior, concatenate them across all chunks and cells of
a condition, and histogram the pooled samples in log10. That requires either
persisting the per-window sample pool in the Experiment stage or a dedicated
resampling pass over the real videos; it is left as a documented extension.
